# TabletopSimulatorCollectionManager
This program is intended to make sorting Tabletop simulator collections easier. 

The program translates mod files into their mod names and allows the user to move files in their Workshop folder. 
It supports moving files in individually and/or as groups.

Run the script as python 3.0 or run the standalone executable in your My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Mods\Workshop\ folder.

I cannot guarantee the safety of this tool at the moment, however I believe it is safe and have subjected it to rigorous testing.
Use at your own risk.
